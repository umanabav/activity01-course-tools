*  So, the reason I selected this meme is, its exactly how my weekends going past couple of weeks. For the whole week i have been working 40 hours and taking classes etc. During the whole week I will be waiting for weekends so that I can do some fun things watch movies but when the weekends arrive I feel like takimg some rest and save some energy for next week is better than going out and spending time ðŸ˜‘.

## **Thoughts**

*  One way I would like to share information is participating in discussions through teams or blackboard where we can read thoughts and opinion of everyone in the class and we can reply to their discussion. Sharing through online class is also going good but I felt like may through discussion posting we can get some time to think about more ideas and noting others information which could be useful.

## **Website/blog/portfolio**

 Among all the Website/blog/portfolio provided this is one of the website I liked most : https://desiree.rbind.io/. 
 
 In terms of its template and looks, the website has a minimalist design with a clean and organized layout. The website uses a black and white color scheme with occasional accents of pink, making it easy to read and visually appealing. The font and typography are simple yet elegant, contributing to the website's overall aesthetic.

And through the content, the website contains blog posts on a variety of topics related to data science, statistics, and programming using R. Desiree also includes tutorials, code snippets, and other resources to help readers improve their skills in these areas. The website appears to be targeted towards individuals interested in data science, especially those with a background in statistics and programming. It provides valuable resources and insights into the world of data science and programming using R, while also showcasing a well-designed and aesthetically pleasingÂ website.
